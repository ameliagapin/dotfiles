# dotfiles

This is my current dotfile and bootstrap script iteration.

This script should bootstrap MacOS and Linux distros using apt or yum.

## Info

Created using [init-dotfiles](https://github.com/Vaelatern/init-dotfile) and using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), with much inspiration from [jakedex/dotfiles](https://github.com/jakedex/dotfiles)

## Usage

Clone and run `install.sh`.
